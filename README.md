# Scale Integration for Odoo POS

This repository contains software for integrating digital scales into Odoo Point of Sale (POS) systems. The software facilitates communication with scales that were not originally designed to be connected to external devices. It includes microcontroller programs for reading weight data via UART and exposing it via a small web server, making it compatible with Odoo POS. Multiple scales with different communication protocols can be supported, with the repository extending for future integrations with other scales.

## Supported Scales
